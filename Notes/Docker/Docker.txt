What is docker ?
Why docker ?
What is a container ?
What is the client server architecture in Docker.
What is an docker image ?

Docker Registry -> Similar to GitHub. Contains a lot of repository.
Docker Repository -> Different versions of a Docker image is maintained.
Docker Image -> A file which conatins all the necessary info (Dependencies, Libraries, Runtime, etc,.) for an App to run 
Docker Container -> The running version of an Image. 
 
 
docker run -m 512m --cpu-quota 50000 -p 5000:5000 -d --restart=always in28min/todo-rest-api-h2:1.0.0.RELEASE
	-m 512m -> Allocates 512mb of ram to the container.
	--cpu-quota 50000 -> Allocates 50% of the CPU to the container.
	-p 5000:5000 -> -p{hostPort}:{containerPort}  Exposing container port to localhost port.
	-d -> Detaching the application and run it in background.
	--restart=always -> When the docker demon is restarted, the container starts automatically.
	in28min/todo-rest-api-h2:1.0.0.RELEASE -> {repositoryName:imageVersionName}
	
docker logs containerId -> Show logs
docker logs -f containerId -> Tailing the logs.
docker container ls / docker ps -> Lists all running containers
docker container ls -a / docker ps -a -> Lists all containers [All states - Running, stopped]
docker container stop containerId -> Stops a running container

docker images -> Lists all images available in local.
docker tag {repositoryName}:{tagName } {repositoryName}:{newTagName} -> Create tag for existing images name.
docker pull {repositoryName}:{tagName} -> Downloads the image to the local repository.
docker search {repositoryName} -> To search for image in docker respository.
docker image history imageId -> To view the history of the image [Image creation and updation and everything]
docker image inspect imageId ->  To view all the config and other data related to that image.
docker image remove imageId -> To delete the image from the local repository.

docker container run {repositoryName}:{tagName} / docker run {repositoryName}:{tagName}  -> Create a new container out of an image and run it.
docker container pause {containerId} -> Pause the running container with the state of the application maintained.
docker container unpause {containerId}  -> Unpause the paused container.
docker container stop {containerId} -> Stops the container compleatly. [Some time is give for the application to stop and the container is stopped]
docker container kill {containerId} -> Force the container as it is. [No time is given and container is stopped immediatly]
docker container prune -> Removes all the stopped containers.

docker events -> Shows the logs and status of all the container.
docker top {containerId} -> Show the details of that container.
docker stats -> To see the metrics of all the running containers.
docker system df -> To see overall useage of docker resources (Memory consumed by images, volumes, caches etc,.)
