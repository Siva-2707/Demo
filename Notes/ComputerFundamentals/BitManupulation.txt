Binary Negative Numbers 
	(Converting Positive to Negative)
	-Invert all the bits and add one.

Shifting 
	- Right Shifting (Shift all bits one position to right) New bit will be zero.
		In decimal convertion, the number will be divided by 2.
	- Left Shifting (Shift all bits one position to left) New bit will be zero.
		In decimal convertion, the number will be multiplied by 2.
	
	In logical shifting, negative bit is also shifted and new bit will be 0.
	In arithmetic shifting, negative bit is also shifted but the new bit will maintain the same old negative bit.
