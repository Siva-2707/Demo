Infrastructure As A Service (IAAS)
	- All physical components are provided by the cloud. (RAM,ROM, CPU, etc.,.)
	
	

AWS Services


Account Types
	1. Root account 
	2. IAM account (Identity and access management)

-Cloud Watch - Watches the cloud for the settings set

-Elastic compute cloud(EC2) / Virtual Machine(Azure)
	- Security groups (Allows only to use specific data by the user)
		-All traffic is blocked by default and a security group rule allows external traffic.
		-A security group with no rules by default means all traffic is being blocked.
	- Auto scaling
		-Vertical scaling     Vertical scaling is increasing the physical hardware to a single server. 
		-Horizontal scaling   Horizontal scaling spreads traffic across several identical servers.
	



-Elastic Block Storage(EBS) (Fastest storage access)
	-Primary storage for EC2 instances
	-Hardrives for VM
	-EBS cannot be shrared among multiple EC2
	-Can be cloned and shrared to other EC2 instance but cannot be synced
	
-Elastic File Storage(EFS) (Slower than EBS)
	-EFS can be shrared and synced among multiple EC2s

-Simple Storage Service(S3) (Slower than EFS and EBS)
	-Don't need server to configure like EBS and EFS
	-Similar to DropBox
	-Can store all formats of file (txt, img, video, etc)
	-Can restict the access as Public or Private
	
-S3 Glacier
	-Cheaper version of S3
	-Takes time to access files
	
-Cloud Front (CDN -Continous Delevering Network)
	-Shares the copy of S3 instance all across the world for faster access

-Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
	-Creates a virtual network so that servers/EC2 instances can talk to one another
	
	-Gateways
		-Internet Gateway
		-NAT Gateway
		
		A NAT gateway will not allow public originating internet traffic to pass to a server, but an Internet gateway will allow it.

	-Elastic IP
		-Constant Public IP provided by amazon
		-Will be charged when not used
	
	-AWS Client VPN
		-Connects to VPC
		-Enable local machine to connect to VPC 
	
-Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)
	-Network Load Balancer
	-Application Load Balancer
	
	An ALB is used for HTTP traffic, and an NLB is used for traffic that requires speed, like low-latency streaming services.
	
-Database Migration Service
	-Enable smooth migration of Database to the cloud

-Relational Database Service(RDS)  	
-Dynamo DB (Used for NoSQL DBs)

-ElastiCache

-DataLake
	-Large amount of unorganised data
	-Stored in S3
-DataWarehouse
	-Large amount of organised data
	-Usually stored in a RDB
	-Amazon uses Redshift for managing data of this type
	
BigData services:-
	-Redshift
	-Athena
	-EMR
