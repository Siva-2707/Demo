Creational Design Pattern
=========================
-Factory Method Pattern
define an interface or abstract class for creating an object but let the subclasses decide which class to instantiate

-Abstract Factory Pattern
define an interface or abstract class for creating families of related (or dependent) objects but without specifying their concrete sub-classes

-Builder Pattern 
construct a complex object from simple objects using step-by-step approach

-Singleton Pattern
define a class that has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it

-Prototype Pattern
cloning of an existing object instead of creating new one and can also be customized as per the requirement.
