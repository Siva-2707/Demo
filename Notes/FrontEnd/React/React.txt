Code is written in Declarative Way

React runs on Node.js [Runtime]
React uses JSX - Javascript XML to render dynamic content.
Each thing is divided into a component. 
Value from parent component to child component can be passed using props.
useState - A react hook is used to maintain state and re-render content when the state is changed.
Lifting the state up -> Values from child component can be passed to parent component by, passing the reference alone to the child component where the implementation stays in the parent component.
State and stateless components.
