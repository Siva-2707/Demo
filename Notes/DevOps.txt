DevOps Process:
1. Code
2. Build 
3. Test 
4. Release
5. Deploy
6. Operate 
7. Monitor
8. 

Version Control System - GIT
Build Tool - Maven

CI - Continous Integration - Jenkins, Travis CI, Bamboo, Buildbot

Jenkins- Written in JAVA - Early reference (Hudson) 

Steps followed in Jenkins
------------------------
Compile and Build Code
Runs scripts
Starts integrated tests
Monitor execution of tasks
Stops build in case of failure
Notify user about the status of Build
Deploys in test env

Testing
========
Tools - JUnit, Pytest, Selenium
Automated and Manual Testing

Automated Testing
- Unit Test 		-> Tests the application without external dependencies (Fast execution)
- Integrated Test	-> Tests the application with external dependencies	(Slow execution)
- End-to-End Test	-> Test the Whole application(Tool - Selenium) 	(Very slow execution)

Testing Frameworks
- NUnit
- MSTest
- xUnit
- reSharper
-JUnit

JUnit - Jave Framework for unit testing

Annotations used:-
@Test - specify it as a test case
@Before -  Executed before every test
@After - Executed after every test
@BeforeClass - Executed before every class (And method should be of static)
@AfterClass - Executed after every class (And method should be of static)

assertEquals();

JUnit Test suit - Used to run a set of JUnit tests

Continous Deployment (CD)
=========================
Continous delivery is done for the client after a series of operations peromed. (Deployment is done manually)
Continous Deployement is same as Continous Delivery, But Deployement is also automated in this case.

Three things that results in CD
1. Configuration Management
2. Continous Integration
3. Continous Testing
