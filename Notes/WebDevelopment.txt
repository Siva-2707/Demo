Different Networking Protocols
==============================

Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
	This is a protocol used to send request to the server and receive response from the server.
	There are differnt methods available like (	GET, PUT, POST, DELETE, etc.,)
Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS)
	This is same as HTTP but more secure. This is because the request and response are encrypted end-to-end.
	The below status codes indicates if there is any failure during the request or response cycle.
	HTTP Status Codes
	Information 	- 	(100-199)
	Success 		- 	(200-299)
	Redirection 	- 	(300-399)
	Client Error	- 	(400-499)
	Server Error	- 	(500-599)

Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)

Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)
	When an computer connects to a network, it is assigned with a Dynamic IP address using UDP(User Datagram Protocol)

Domain Name System Protocol (DNS)
	This protocol returns the IP address of the domain which we are trying to connect to. 

Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP)
	This protocol helps in managing the mailbox, like downloading the messages in the server, storing all the attachments, etc.,

Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)
	This protocol allows you to send mails to other client, it is also used to receive mails from IMAP but it is not commonly used.
	
Post Office Protocol (POP)
	It is the old protocol used to manage mails.
	The main differece between IMAP and POP is that, the mails get deleted once it is downloaded to your local machine.

-Libraries are functions or tools that is ready to use. (Promotes code reusability)

APIs - Application Programming Interface
