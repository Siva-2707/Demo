Youtube : Code Karle


System Design is the process of designing the architecture, components, and interfaces for a system so that it meets the end-user requirements.


Scalability
	-Horizontal Scaling (Adding more resources)
		-Requires Load Balancer 
	*	-Resilient
		-Network between resources (Slow)
		-Data inconsistancy
	*	-Scales well 	
	-Verical Scaling (Upgading to next level resource)
		-Does not require a load balancer
		-Single Point failure (If one machine failure thats all)
	*	-Interprocessing (Fast)
	*	-Data consistancy
		-Hardware Limitation
