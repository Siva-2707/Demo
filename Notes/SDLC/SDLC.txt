SDLC - Software Development Lifecycle

Traditional Software development approach
	
	Waterfall - Step by step development process
	---------
	Phases in Waterfall model
	 1) Requirement gathering 
	 2) Analysis and Designing
	 3) Development phase
	 4) Test phase
	 5) Deployment and Maintenance phase
	
	Disadvantages of Waterfall method
	 1) Late delivery
	 2) No modifications after the requirement phase has been passed.
	 3) Since Deployment is done at last. Any issue faced then will cause the whole project to be a failure.
	 
	 Spiral Model - Iterative approach (Combination of Iterative and Waterfall approach)
	 -------------
	 
	Phases in each Iteration
	 1) Planning
	 2) Risk Analysis
	 3) Engineering
	 4) Evaluation
	
	 Here a series of Iteration is occured till the final project is completed.
	 
    Rational Unified Process(RUP) 
	-----------------------------
	 - It is a software development process framework
	 - It has large knowledge base.
	 - Package of Artifacts, processes,
	 
Early Agile Software development approach.

	DSDM (Dynamic System Development Method)
	----------------------------------------
	 - It is a framework which followes tight set of rules.
	 
	Stages involved:
	 1) Pre - project stage.
			Analysis, cost-estimation and commitments are made.
	 2) Project life cycle
			Iterative development
	 3) Post - project stage.
			Discussion after product is delivered. Product feedback and suggestions are done.

	Feature Driven Development (FDD)
	--------------------------------
	 - Here a feature is developed iteratively.
	 - It is lightweight
	 Refer photo for Life cycle.
	
	Crystal Methods
	---------------
	
Modern Agile Method
--------------=-----
