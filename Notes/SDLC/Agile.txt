Traditional Method (Waterfall Method)

Its a step by step process
The customer gets the product only when it's fully completed.
No ideas can be added in the middle 


Agile Method
- Goes through sprints
- Piece of deliverable product is given to customer end of each sprint
- New ideas can be added to the sprint 
- Each sprint goes through All the process( Design -> Develop -> Test -> Deploy )

Agile Frameworks
================
Scrum - Kanban


Agile Values
=============
1) Individuals and Interactions  		over processes and tools 
2) Working software 						over comprehensive documentation
