Arrays:

1. Two Sum

2. Maximum Subarray

3. Move Zeroes

4. Contains Duplicate

5. Rotate Array

Bonus:
This question is the type of problems that can be done using what we know about arrays, or even regular expressions.

Arrays
	Static 
	Dynamic
Linked List
	Singly (Current node, next node) 
	Doubly (Previous node, current node, next node)

Stacks 
	Arrays are linked list can be used. 
	
Queue
	Linked list is prefered. Since we have to shift elements if we use a array.
	Circular arrays are used if the size of the queue is static.

Tree
	Binary Tree
		Balanced (The number of nodes in the last level == (sum of all the nodes present before it) +1
		Unbalanced 
		Best case O(log N) -> Balanced Binary tree
		Worst case O(N) -> Unbalanced Binaray tree
		
Heap
	Binary Heap
		Trees are construcntor in ascending or descending order.
		Used mostly when conditon is given based on increasing or decreaing order. (Like records for data greater than or less than the given value.)
		
		
Graphs
	Directed
	Undirected
	Weighted 
	Un-weighted
	Cyclic
	Acyclic
	
		Ways of representing Graphs
			-Edge List
			-Adjacent List
			-Adjacent Matrix
		
		Neo4j used for buiding Graph data structures
