Recursive

	-Identify base case for the recursion to break
	-Identify the recursive case.
	-Get closer and closer and return. Two returns are required, one for base case and one for recursive case.
	
Sorting
	Elemenary Sorts
		-Bubble Sort O(N^2)
			Not used anywhere, just for understanding sorting.
			Simplest and Least effecient
		-Insersion Sort
			-Used for small datasets and nearly sorted dataset.
			Quick in case of nearly sorted data.
		-Selection Sort O(N^2)
			Not used much.
			Selecting the minimum or maximum element from the list and swaping it to the begining of the list
	Complex Sorts
		-Merge Sort O(n log(N)) 
			-Fast but uses O(N) space.
			Follows Divide and Concure methodology.
		-Quick Sort
			-Fast and better space complexity.
			-Popular sorting algo.
		-Heap Sort
			
		-Radix and Counter Sort
			Mostly used for Integer values.
			Has less time complexity.

Searching 
	Linear 
	Binary
	Breath First Search
		Helps in finding the shortest path to the node.
		Occupies more memory compared to DFS.
	Depth First Search
		Occupies less memory
		To check if a path exists or not.
		Can take long time for large dataset.
