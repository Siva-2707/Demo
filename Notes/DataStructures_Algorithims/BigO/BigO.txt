O(1) - Constant time
O(n) - Linera time
O(n^2) - Quadratic time
O(n!) - Factorial time



Rules to calculate BigO

Worst case 
Remove constants
Different terms for inputs
	O(a+b) or O(a*b) for different input
Drop non dominants
	In case of O(n + n^2), we can eleminate n and keep BigO as O(n^2) as it is the bigger 

Time complexity:
Calculated by BigO 
Space complexity:
Memory has two areas:
	Heap -> Variables are stored here.
	Stack -> Keeping track of function calls
