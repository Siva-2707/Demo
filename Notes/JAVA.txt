Java 

Variables
	- Primitive type
	- Reference type 
Operators
Conditional Statements
Looping statements
Methods
OOPS 
 - Encapsulation
 - Inheritance 
 - Abstraction
 - Polimorphisam
 
Class and Objects
	- Interface
	- InnerClass
		- DefaultInnerClass (Need the instance of the OuterClass to access it)
		- StaticInnerClass (No need the instance of the OuterClass to access it)
	- Abstract Class
	- Annonimous Class
 
Arrays and ArrayList
Variable Argument

Collection APIs
	- List
		- ArrayList (Good for searching and sorting)
		- LinkedList (Good for manupulating the list) Inserting deleting elements
		- Vector (It is syncronized) So thread safe
	- Set (Duplicate elements are not allowed in Set)
		- HashSet (Follows random order)
		- LinkedHashSet		
		- TreeSet (Follows insertion order)
	- Queue
		-PriorityQueue
	- Map
		- HashMap
		- HashTable
		- LinkedHashMap
		- TreeMap

Generics
	- AutoBoxing 
	- UnBoxing
	
Comparator class and Comparable Interface

Java Packages

Access Modifiers
	- Public                   --> Available everywhere
	- Default (unmentioned)    --> Available only inside the package and not available even if the class is extended outside the package.
	- Protected				   --> Available inside the same package and the subclasses of even different package.
	- Private				   --> Available only inside the defined class
	
	A class can only be public or default
	

Scope and Visibility
Final keyword
	- Final class cannot be extended
	- Final method cannot be overridden

Static keyword
	- Only one instance is created and shared among all the instance.
	- Static method cannot have a non-static member.
	

Functional Programming (Stream API) and Functional Interface
	- Predicate
Threds and Multithreads
	
	-Ways of enabling Thread
		-Extending the thread class
		-Implementing the runnable Interface
		-Implementing the callable Interface (Returns a value)
		
	
	-States of a thread 
		- New 
		- Runnable 
		- Blocked
		- Waiting
		- Timed Waiting / 
		- Terminated/ Dead
	
	-Executor Service(API)
	-Future Class
	
	-Concurrency
		- syncronized keyword
		- locks
		- Automic classes -> java.util.concurrent.atomic (Thread safe class)

Exceptional Handeling
	- Try Catch Finally
	- Checked and Unchecked exceptions
	- Exception Hierarchy

Files Concept 
	- Old method
	- Functional programming
	
Logger

Misselanious Concepts
- Static imports
- InnerClass
- Enum
	- Ordinal
	- Constructors
- Comparator class and Comparable Interface
- GarbageCollector

After Java 8
- Modularity 
- Predicate not method
- Set/ Map/ List - copyOf method 
- String API
- Type Inferences
- Switch Expressions
- TextBlock
- Records (Similar to Java Beans)
