Servlets
=========
Servlet - Class that extends HttpServlet class.
Processes HttpRequest HttpResponse objects.

Passing values to other servlets :-
By RequestDispatcher class -------------------
											  ----- Need to compare				
By sendRedirect method of Response object. ---
Cookies
Sessions

ServletConfig and ServletContext - Used in setting default values for Servlets. Specified in web.xml  
ServletConfig - Specific to each Servlet in the project. Overrides  ServletContext.
ServletContext - Commen to all the Servlets in the project. 

Servlet Filters
Class that extends ServletFilter class.
Methods in ServletFilter Class:-
	-init()
	-doFilter()
	-destroy()
Filter chaining - Linking Filters
FilterConfig - Configuring Filters


Session Tracking Techniques
-----------------------------
Cookies
URL Rewriteing
Hidden Form Field
HTTP Session

JSP - Java Server Pages -> Create dynamic webpages
=======================
JSP is converted to Servlet automatically

Tages used in JSP:-
Directive <%@page import = "com.siva.demo"  %> -- Import package 
Declaration <%! int n; %> -- Globally declared into the Servlet
Scriptlet <%    %> -- Goes into service method of Servlet
Expresstion<%=  n %> -- Prints the value into Browser. Alternative for out.println().

Attributes used in Directive Tag:
@page
@include  -> Includes other JSPs into the current file.
@taglib

Implicite Objects:-  Don't need to instansiate.

JSP Objects		  Servlet Objects
------------------------------------
request		 	- HttpRequest
response	 	- HttpResponse
pageContext  	- PageContext  --> Similar to ServletContext and ServletConfig. But, Scope is limited to the page.
out(JspWriter) 	- PrintWriter
session 		- HttpSession
application 	- ServletContext
config			- ServletConfig

Model View Controller (MVC) 
===========================

Request is sent to the Servlet(Controller) and the servlet passes the POJO-Plain Old Java Object(Model) to the JSP file(View) and JSP is sent as response to the request sent.

Service class and DAO _ Used to process Database codes.

Controller
View
Model

JSTL - JSP Standard Tag Library (Used in JSP)
================================

Add -> <% @taglib prefix="" uri="" %>
Can use tags or Expresstion language.

Tag types:-
Core
SQL
Functional

Example:-
Expression language : "{$name}"
Tag : <c:out value="{$name}" var=> <

EJB - Enterprise Java Beans

EJBs are nothing but java classes that are used to process Bussiness Logic.

Types:
Stateless
Stateful
Singleton

Stateless
A simple class is created, with the variables and the bussiness logic.
Here the state of the bean is not saved.
The class is annotated as @Stateless

Stateful
Here the state of the bean is saved.
Where an inteface is created, and a class implementing the interface is created.
The interface is annotated as @Remote
The class is annotated as @Stateful
Configure Initial Context in jspInit() method of JSP using the lookup() method.
